# Puppy App

![Workflow result](https://github.com/seth0027/compose-template/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description

The app displays a list of puppies and information about the puppies, detail screen is not working
because the compose navigation library is very unstable and is throwing some errors

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Interesting part was building the UI with compose declarative pattern, it reduced the boilerplate
code to very much percentages. I was able to get/collect some data on puppies, actually getting the
data from sources took much longer than putting it to the app.
